    "As you move from left to right across a period, the number of protons in the nucleus increases. The electrons are thus attracted to the nucleus more strongly, and the atomic radius is smaller (this attraction is much stronger than the relatively weak repulsion between electrons). As you move down a column, there are more protons, but there are also more complete energy levels below the valence electrons. These lower energy levels shield the valence electrons from the attractive effects of the atom's nucleus, so the atomic radius gets larger.",
    "A crystal forms to balance the forces of repulsion and attraction amongst the ions. Some ionic compounds form different structures depending on how the are solidified (whether they are created through rapid or slow cooling, for example). Silica (SiO2) is an example of an ionic compound found with many different structures. When there is enough energy available to the ions, say at higher temperatures, they can move from these ideal, symmetric and balanced geometries and temporarily maintain a less favorable geometry. An ionic liquid is constantly doing this. A crystal's specific structure depends on the size of the ions, because their size affects how the ions pack together.",
    "Gibbs free energy is a measure of how much \"potential\" a reaction has left to do a net \"something.\" So if the free energy is zero, then the reaction is at equilibrium, an no more work can be done. It may be easier to see this using an alternative form of the the Gibbs free energy, such as $Delta G = -TDelta S$.",
    "Remember, the 'size' of an atom has nothing to do with the size of the nucleus. It has to do with the size of the valence shell (which itself is not well-defined*). So, if we neglect change in electrical attraction, the size should stay the sameâ€”a shell is a shell and it need not 'expand' to accomodate electrons. Now, as we add more protons and electrons, the attraction between the nucleus and shell increases and the shell contracts. Thus the atom gets smaller. *Shells reach 'til infinity, so it's better to define the size on the basis of 'the electrons of the outermost shell will be within this region x% of the time.' This only changes this answer a tiny bit. Now, we say 'the probability of finding the electrons closer to the center increases due to increased nuclear charge.",
